Creating a full-fledged e-commerce web application with separate modules for admin, employee, and user functionality is a comprehensive project. Here's a breakdown of each module and its functionalities:

   - **Shopping Cart:** Users can manage their shopping carts by adding, removing, or updating the quantity of items.
   - **Checkout:** Users can proceed to checkout, enter shipping details, and choose payment options.
   - **Order History:** Users can view their past orders and track their current orders.

   - **Order Management:** Admins can view all orders, update order statuses (processing, shipped, delivered, etc.), and manage customer orders.
   - **User Management:** Admins can view user details, such as registration information, order history, and manage user accounts (suspend, delete, etc.).

### 3. Employee Module:

### Technologies Used:
